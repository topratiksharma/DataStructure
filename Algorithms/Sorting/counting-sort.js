/* In counting sort algorithm
 * You create an another array where we increase the value in index of each element present in main array by there number of occurences.
 * now once the array is populated we populate a new object with the number of occurences occured in the current new array
 * eg: [2, 1, 5, 6, 6, 5, 2, 3]
 * output array = [1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2]
 * here above populated array represents that 1 occured once , two occured twice, 3 once, 4 not present, 5 twice and so on
 * This algorith can only be used for positive integers.
