Searching algorithms
- 1.) Linear Search
- 2.) Binary Search
- 3.) Ternary Search
- 4.) Jump Search
- 5.) Exponential Search

Linear: each item is inspected once to find the number of items

Binary :
It works only on sorted algorithms, so if the list in not sorted then it requires more time.
we devide the array in two parts from middle and then compare if the item is on left or right side of the array.
if the finding item is smaller than the middle of the array then we assume that it exists in the left side of the array 
and we discard the right side of the array and then again devide the left part in two parts from middle to repeat the procedure.

Ternary Search : 
In ternary search we devide array in 3 parts keeping mid1 and mid 2 as pointers, and compare if the target is present on the
each index (mid1 and mid2) if not then we compare which one is higher after comparing the values. if found we again devide 
and then the array in three parts.

Jump Search : 
In Jump search we devide the sorted array into blocks and then compare last element of the each block with target.
if found then we return if not then we see if its smaller or large. if its smaller then we search the current block.
if large then we move to next block. If not found and we reach end of the array then we conclude.

Exponential Search:
In this search we set 1 pointer and then double it on each iteration if the item do not exist in that range.
